# WebApp

## Overview

This application is designed as a cloud-native, RESTful web service.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Implements REST principles for intuitive and efficient resource manipulation over HTTP, making it easy for clients to interact with the service.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Designed from the ground up to run in cloud environments, supporting dynamic scaling, configuration management, and seamless integration with cloud services.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Spring Data JPA for robust database interactions, supporting multiple relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Security**: Implements Spring Security to provide comprehensive security features, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**: Includes a suite of unit and integration tests, ensuring the reliability and quality of the service.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For rapid application development and easy configuration.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For efficient database access and management.
- **Spring Security**: For securing REST endpoints.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across different deployment environments.
- **Cloud Providers (AWS/GCP/Azure)**: For hosting the application, taking advantage of cloud scalability and services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Java JDK 17 or newer
- Maven 3.6 or newer (if building from source)
- Access to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), including credentials and connection details

## Setting Up the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [Repository URL]
   cd [Repository Directory]

2. **Configure Database Connection**

    Edit the src/main/resources/application.properties file to include your database connection details:

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password

    Replace the values with your actual database URL, username, and password

3. **Build the Application**

    Run the following command in the root directory of the project to build the application:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install

4. **Running the Application**

    After setting up the application, you can run it using either Maven or directly via the built JAR file.

## Accessing the Application

    Once the application is running, you can access it by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser or using a tool like Postman to interact with the REST API endpoints.
